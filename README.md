# Code Quiz : ZORAN

As we proceed in our journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, itâ€™s likely that weâ€™ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help myself become familiar with these tests and give me a chance to apply the skills from this module, this weekâ€™s Challenge had us build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
